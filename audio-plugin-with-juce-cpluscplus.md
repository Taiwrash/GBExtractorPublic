## Here are the steps I will take to achieve the task within a week.

Audio plugin using C++ and the JUCE framework. JUCE (Jules' Utility Class Extensions) is a cross-platform C++ library for building audio applications. It provides a set of classes for audio processing, user interface, and other common tasks, as well as a framework for creating audio plugins in various formats (such as VST, AU, and AAX).

Here is an overview of the steps involved in creating an audio plugin with C++ and JUCE:

- Install the JUCE library and set up your development environment.

- Create a new JUCE project using the Projucer, which is a cross-platform IDE included with JUCE. The Projucer allows you to set up the basic structure of your plugin and choose the formats you want to support.

- Implement the audio processing and user interface code for your plugin using the classes provided by JUCE. This will involve subclassing the appropriate JUCE classes and overriding their virtual methods.

- Build and test your plugin using the Projucer or your preferred development environment.

- Export your plugin for distribution in the desired formats.

Let me know what you think and I can still proceed with this design.

Thanks
